# Multinomial Logistic Regression with Shrinkage Toward Equal Weights (STEW) penalty

This repository contains a Python implementation of multinomial logistic regression for discrete choice modelling. It can be used with or without regularization.
Furthermore, the `MlogitData` class provides a simple way of storing choice set data, on which multinomial logistic regression is trained.
